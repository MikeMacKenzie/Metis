# Metis
Some work from my time as a Data Scientist at the Metis Data Science Bootcamp.  
Projects were started and completed on a tight deadline (typically 2-3 weeks).


## Coming Soon!  
- Understanding Clicking Behavior with Machine Learning (Logistic Regression) and A/B Testing.
- Natural Language Processing and Topic Modeling the Scripts of Friends and Seinfeld.
